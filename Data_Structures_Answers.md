Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
O(n), because each value gets rant through atleast once

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
O(n)

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
O(n), because each value gets rant through atleast once

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
O(n)

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
O(n^2), 2 nested loops

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
O(l1, l2, d)  where l1 is the ammount of names in first list of names and l2 is the ammount of names in the second list and d is the array for holding the duplicates so removing the constants it would O(n)

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
O(n), bacause we only check each element once

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
O(l1, l2, d, sd), same as previous solution for provided code but an additional dictionary so removing the constants it would O(n)
